    <p1>Filan Tech is a technology institute that invests in the younger generation of tomorrow's leaders and promotes skills that donâ€™t require a degree.
        </p1><br> <br>
    <p2>Every student can benefit from it in a short period of time. 
        There is a great need for this field for students from IT backgrounds 
        as well as those from non-IT backgrounds. Our team is interested in 
        creating digital products for the learned students who want to study 
        these programs. FilanTech is an education and work site where one's 
        job is to teach oneself the skills of programming and English. 
        The purpose of FilanTech is to provide job training to the person 
        while learning the skill and, after learning, to help them find a job. 
        Because Filantech is about developing skills that can make people work 
        for themselves.</p2><br>
